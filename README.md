# Build Something!

Hi there. Thanks for expressing some interest in working with us here at <Company> on a technical project. We'd like to give you an opportunity to show us a little bit about how you think about problem solving, what technologies you're interested in, and how you develop something from nothing.

### Summary

For our little assignment, we'd like you to spend 1-3 hours creating a piece of technology that does something.

Does what? That doesn't matter.

What we're looking for in the end is something that we can spin up and play with to see how you leverage your technical skills. This could be a local Vagrant stack, a Dockerfile, something on a Cloud provider (free tier, hopefully!), or something else altogether. It's up to you.

### Requirements

In order to fully engage with the goal of this effort, please treat this as you would a miniature version of a proof of concept (POC) that you'd deliver to a client. That means letting us see a bit of commit history, how'd you'd document your solution, and a bit of creativity in showing us some technology. Feel free to riff on the countless guides out there, we're not too concerned with totally original effort.

What we do want to see however is your particular approach, so let that shine through.

As mentioned, please spend at MAXIMUM three hours on this effort. Most of our applications clock in around two hours on the effort, and we're not looking for anything more. Think of this like a private blog post that you're sharing directly with us.

The last requirement is to have fun, so don't do something you dislike.

### Issues, Questions and Improvements

Feel free to use the full functionality of Github in your project. If you have thoughts on how we could make this process better, we'd be interested in hearing about it. We're interested in your ability to implement modern infrastructure and applications, with a general knowledge of systems and or application administration.

Once you're done, let us know.

Cheers.
